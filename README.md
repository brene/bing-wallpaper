# Installation
``` Python
pip install requests
``` 
# Usage
Just call:
``` Python
python wallpaper.py
```
And the wallpaper will be saved to a file called `wallpaper.jpg`.

# Notice
Sometimes there can be issues, if your computer has different versions of Python. If you have Python 3, you should call `pip3` instead of `pip` and `python3` instead of `python`
